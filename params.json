Device and application information, if available.\r\n    - Device screen resolution, mobile data and GPS states, ...\r\n- **Screenshot capture**. \r\n    - Because receiving a feedback with contextual information is much much \r\n    better for analysis, Maoni allows to take a screenshot of the calling activity. \r\n    Note that the inclusion of such screenshot in the feedback object is opt-out, at the user's discretion.\r\n    - Touch to preview screenshot\r\n- **Customization**.\r\n    - Besides the default form fields, you are free to include an extra layout \r\n    with additional views. And you always have access to the underlying view elements.\r\n    - Theme elements and styles can be adjusted.\r\n- **Callbacks**.\r\n    - Form validation. You can provide your own if needed for example for your extra fields.\r\n    - Listeners. Upon validation, Maoni calls the callbacks implementations you provided earlier.\r\n    So you just have limitless possibilities for an integration with any other systems.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the [sample application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.rm3l.maoni.sample) \r\nfor a quick overview.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivations\r\n\r\nWhile working on a new version of [DD-WRT Companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.rm3l.ddwrt), \r\none my Android apps, I needed a simple yet pleasant way to collect users' feedbacks, \r\nalong with some contextual information.\r\nI experimented with a simple dialog, then tried a bunch of other libraries, \r\nbut could not find one with screenshot capturing capabilities, not vendor lock-in, \r\nand which is almost a no-brainer as to integrating with any remote services.\r\n\r\nSo as a way to give back to the Open Source community, \r\nI decided to create Maoni as a separate library project.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, Maoni is a Swahili word for comments or opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Sample App\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.rm3l.maoni.sample\">\r\n  <img alt=\"Get it on Google Play\"\r\n       src=\"https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n    <img width=\"30%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm3l/maoni/master/doc/screenshots/raw/1_Maoni_main_activity.png\"/>\r\n    <img height=\"0\" width=\"8px\"/>\r\n    <img width=\"30%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm3l/maoni/master/doc/screenshots/raw/2_Maoni_main_activity_with_screenshot_thumbnail.png\"/>\r\n    <img height=\"0\" width=\"8px\"/>\r\n    <img width=\"30%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm3l/maoni/master/doc/screenshots/raw/3_Maoni_main_activity_with_screenshot_touch_to_preview.png\"/>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nGrab via Gradle, by adding this to your `build.gradle`:\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\n  dependencies {\r\n    // ...\r\n    compile ('org.rm3l:maoni:2.0.0@aar') {\r\n        transitive = true;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Putting it together\r\n\r\nIntegrating with Maoni is intended to be seamless and straightforward for most existing \r\nAndroid applications.\r\n\r\nJust leverage the fluent Maoni Builder to construct and start an Maoni instance at the right place \r\nwithin your application workflow (for example a button click listener, or a touch of a menu item).\r\n\r\nFor example, to start with just the defaults:\r\n```java\r\n    // MyHandlerForMaoni is a custom implementation of Handler, \r\n    // which is a shortcut interface for defining both a validator and listeners for Maoni\r\n    final MyHandlerForMaoni handlerForMaoni = new MyHandlerForMaoni(MaoniSampleMainActivity.this);\r\n    \r\n    //The optional file provider authority allows you to \r\n    //share the screenshot capture file to other apps (depending on your callback implementation)\r\n    new Maoni.Builder(MY_FILE_PROVIDER_AUTHORITY)\r\n        .withHandler(myHandlerForMaoniInstance) //Custom Callback for Maoni\r\n        .build()\r\n        .start(MaoniSampleMainActivity.this); //The screenshot captured is relative to this calling context \r\n```\r\n\r\nTo customize every aspect of your Maoni activity, call the fluent methods of `Maoni.Builder`, e.g.:\r\n```java\r\n    // MyHandlerForMaoni is a custom implementation of Maoni.Handler, \r\n    // which is a shortcut interface for defining both a validator and listeners for Maoni\r\n    final MyHandlerForMaoni handlerForMaoni = new MyHandlerForMaoni(MaoniSampleMainActivity.this);\r\n    \r\n    //The optional file provider authority allows you to \r\n    //share the screenshot capture file to other apps (depending on your callback implementation)\r\n    new Maoni.Builder(MY_FILE_PROVIDER_AUTHORITY)\r\n        .withWindowTitle(\"Send Feedback\") //Set to an empty string to clear it\r\n        .withMessage(\"Hey! Love or hate this app? We would love to hear from you.\")\r\n        .withExtraLayout(R.layout.my_feedback_activity_extra_content)\r\n        .withHandler(myHandlerForMaoniInstance) //Custom Callback for Maoni\r\n        .withFeedbackContentHint(\"[Custom hint] Write your feedback here\")\r\n        .withIncludeScreenshotText(\"[Custom text] Include screenshot\")\r\n        .withTouchToPreviewScreenshotText(\"Touch To Preview\")\r\n        .withContentErrorMessage(\"Custom error message\")\r\n        .withScreenshotHint(\"Custom test: Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet...\")\r\n        //... there are other aspects you can customize\r\n        .build()\r\n        .start(MaoniSampleMainActivity.this); //The screenshot captured is relative to this calling context \r\n```\r\n\r\n**You're good to go!** Maoni will take care of validating / collecting your users' feedbacks \r\nand call your callbacks implementations. \r\n\r\n#### Available callbacks\r\nSome common callbacks for Maoni are available as external dependencies to include in your application.\r\n\r\n##### maoni-email\r\n\r\nThis callback opens up an Intent for sending an email with the feedback collected.\r\n\r\nAdd this additional line to your `build.gradle`:\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\n  dependencies {\r\n    // ...\r\n    compile 'org.rm3l:maoni-email:2.0.0'\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd set it as the listener for your Maoni instance:\r\n```java\r\n    final org.rm3l.maoni.email.MaoniEmailListener listenerForMaoni = \r\n            new org.rm3l.maoni.email.MaoniEmailListener(...);\r\n    \r\n    new Maoni.Builder(MY_FILE_PROVIDER_AUTHORITY)\r\n        .withListener(listenerForMaoni) //Callback from maoni-email\r\n        //...\r\n        .build()\r\n        .start(MaoniSampleMainActivity.this); //The screenshot captured is relative to this calling context \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Sharing the screenshot with other apps\r\n\r\nThe optional file provider authority specified in the `Maoni.Builder` constructor allows you to \r\nshare the screenshot capture file to other apps (depending on your callback implementation).\r\nBy default, Maoni stores the screenshot file in your application cache directory, \r\nbut this is (again) entirely customizable.\r\n\r\nYou must declare a file content provider in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file with an explicit list \r\nof sharable directories for other apps to be able to read the screenshot file. \r\nFor example:\r\n```xml\r\n<application>\r\n    <!-- ... -->\r\n    <!-- If not defined yet, declare a file provider to be able to share screenshots captured by Maoni -->\r\n    <provider\r\n        android:name=\"android.support.v4.content.FileProvider\"\r\n        android:authorities=\"org.rm3l.maoni.sample.fileprovider\"\r\n        android:grantUriPermissions=\"true\"\r\n        android:exported=\"false\">\r\n        <meta-data\r\n            android:name=\"android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS\"\r\n            android:resource=\"@xml/filepaths\" />\r\n    </provider>\r\n</application>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlong with the XML file that specifies the sharable directories (under `res/xml/filepaths.xml` as specified above):\r\n```xml\r\n<paths>\r\n    <!-- By default, Maoni stores screenshots captures in the application cache directory. \r\n    So you must declare the path '.' as shareable. Specify something else if you are using a different path -->\r\n    <cache-path name=\"maoni-shares\" path=\".\" />\r\n    <!-- <files-path path=\"maoni-working-dir/\" name=\"myCustomWorkingDirForMaoni\" /> -->\r\n</paths>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://goo.gl/31nStZ for further instructions on how to setup file sharing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribute and Improve Maoni!\r\n\r\nContributions and issue reporting are more than welcome. \r\nSo to help out, do feel free to fork this repo and open up a pull request. \r\nI'll review and merge your changes as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nYou can use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rm3l/maoni/issues) to report bugs. \r\nHowever, please make sure your description is clear enough and has sufficient instructions \r\nto be able to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nYou can also use the [sample app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.rm3l.maoni.sample) \r\nto send your feedback with Maoni. ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Translations\r\n \r\nI use Crowdin as the translation system. All related resources for localization are automatically generated from files got with Crowdin. \r\n\r\nTo help out with any translation, please head to [Crowdin](http://crowdin.net/project/maoni) \r\nand request to join the translation team. \r\nIf your language is not listed there, just drop me an e-mail at &lt;apps+maoni@rm3l.org&gt;.\r\n\r\nPlease do **not** submit GitHub pull requests with translation fixes as any changes will be overwritten \r\nwith the next update from Crowdin.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributing callbacks for Maoni\r\n\r\nYou can create separate Java projects that implements any of the Maoni callbacks interfaces \r\n(`Validator`, `Listener`, `UiListener`, `Handler` or any combination), \r\nso users can use them in their projects.\r\n\r\nYou just have to include `maoni-common` as a dependency in your project, e.g., with Gradle:\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\n  dependencies {\r\n    // ...\r\n    compile 'org.rm3l:maoni-common:2.0.0'\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## In use in the following apps\r\n\r\n(If you use Maoni, please drop me a line at &lt;apps+maoni@rm3l.org&gt; \r\n(or again, fork, modify this file and submit a pull request), so I can list your app(s) here)\r\n\r\n* [DD-WRT Companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.rm3l.ddwrt)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n* Armel Soro\r\n * [rm3l.org](https://rm3l.org) - &lt;apps+maoni@rm3l.org&gt;\r\n * [paypal.me/rm3l](https://paypal.me/rm3l)\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n    The MIT License (MIT)\r\n    \r\n    Copyright (c) 2016 Armel Soro\r\n    \r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n    \r\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\n    copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n    \r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
